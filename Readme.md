Title: Movie Ticket Booking Management System

Project Description:

This project simulates a basic movie ticket booking system where users can search for movies, view details, and book tickets. The system will use classes and objects to represent movies and bookings. An array of objects will store multiple movie options, and the this operator will be used to reference the current movie or booking object. This system will allow users to choose from available movies, select showtimes, and book tickets.


Features to Implement:

1.Add Movies:
The system will allow an admin to add movies with details such as title, genre, and available showtimes.

2.View Available Movies:
Users will be able to view all the available movies along with their showtimes.

3.Book Tickets:
Users can select a movie, choose a showtime, and book a specific number of seats.

4.View Booking Details:
After booking, users can view the details of their booking (movie title, showtime, and number of seats).

OOP Concepts:

1.Classes & Objects:
The system will include a Movie class that contains attributes like title, genre, and showtime. Each movie will be an object of this class.
A Booking class will represent the booking details, such as the movie, showtime, and the number of tickets booked. Each booking will be an object of this class.
This Operator:
The this operator will be used within the class methods to refer to the current movie or booking object, especially when updating or displaying details.
Array of Objects:
An array of Movie objects will store the available movies in the system. This array will allow users to browse through and select from multiple movies.
Similarly, an array of Booking objects will store multiple user bookings, allowing users to view their booking history.
